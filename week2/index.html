            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
                Now that there is the <b>Tec-9</b>, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. <i>This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime</i>.
                Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime.
                Like they're actually proud of that shit.

                Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
                Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
                Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
            </p>
            <p>
                My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it,
                I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.
                She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and Winston or anybody else
                is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
